///////////UNDERSTANDING THE FOLDER STRUCTURE///////////

This project uses the MVC framework CodeIgniter, meaning it is a Single Page Application. Here is how it works.

There is only one webpage file now, index.php.
Instead of linking to separate html pages, the URL now activates functions in the CONTROLLERS (/application/controllers) which display VIEWS (/application/views) containing html and php code.
If data is required from the database, the controller grabs it via query functions defined in the MODEL (/application/models). Each Controller has a model associated with it.

So for example, if you are looking at localhost/erosion_control/index.php/admin/summary/12, you are activating the summary($id) function with a parameter of 12 in the ADMIN controller. You can find that function in /application/controllers/Admin.php.

So, for any url on the site the format will be localhost/(folder)/index.php/(controller)/(function)/(parameter)/(parameter)/(etc.) If the url has no function after the controller, it is the index() function.

All web php files related to the website are kept in the application folder. CSS/Javascript/Images etc are kept outside the application folder. If they are linked in the html in the view, you need to use the PHP function base_url() (for example, base_url('img/img.jpg');).

Configuration files, like the database settings are kept in application/config/

You should not have to edit any other folders or files (third_party, libraries, language, logs etc).
