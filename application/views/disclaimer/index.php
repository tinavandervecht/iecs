                THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES THE SEPARATE SAFETY FACTORS FOR FAILURE BY OVERTURNING AND SLIDING OF CONCRETE BLOCK REVETMENT SYSTEMS. THIS PROGRAM USES THE OVERTURNING EQUATION IN: "Articulating Concrete Block Revetment Design-Factor of Safety Method"--National Concrete Masonry Association TEK 11-12 and "Bridge Scour and Stream Instability Countermeasures"-- U.S. Department of Transportation, Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 23 (HEC-23). IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM COMPUTES THE FACTOR AGAINST FAILURE DUE TO SLIDING BASED ON THE THEORY OF DAMS IN: "Design of Small Dams", by U.S. Bureau of Reclamation" The equations in this program are calibrated using laboratory studies conducted at: University of Minnesota Colorado State University of Windsor to derive the forces and moments in the Factors of Safety. See CC-TM.
